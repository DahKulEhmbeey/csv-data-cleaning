This is a template for working with CSV files. The template handles reading input CSV files and writing outputs to another CSV file.

## How to use repo

- [Cloning Repo](#cloning-repo)

- [Working with Template](#working-with-template)

## Cloning Repo

Simply run ```git clone https://github.com/dahkulehmbeey/csv-data-cleaning.git``` in your terminal to clone
the repo onto your local machine. If you prefer downloading the repo from github manually, it's still cool!

## Installing Dependencies

cd into the ```csv-data-cleaning``` folder created and
Run ```npm install```
This will install all dependencies used in the project

## Working with Template

Set up the necessary constants in the ```index.js``` file and add your logic to work on the csv file in the `implementLogic()` function. That's all! The template will take of writing outputs to a path you specify.
